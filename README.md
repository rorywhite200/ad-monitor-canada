# Canadian Ad Tracker

## Purpose
Canadian Ad Tracker is a tool that collects, stores, and analyzes Canadian advertising data from Meta platforms. It's designed to support in-depth investigations into digital political advertising, disinformation campaigns, and evolving propaganda narratives.

## Core Functionality
1. **Data Collection**: Automatically harvests daily updates from Meta's Ad Library API.
2. **Data Storage**: Maintains a comprehensive database of ad content, including ads that have been removed or altered.
3. **Advanced Querying**: Enables multi-parameter searches across advertiser details, ad content, targeting information, and temporal data.
4. **Data Export**: Generates custom datasets and reports based on user-defined criteria.

## Key Capabilities
- Overcomes Meta's data limits by maintaining a continuous, cumulative dataset.
- Allows tracking of ads across their entire lifecycle.
- Facilitates identification of coordinated advertising campaigns across seemingly unrelated entities.
- Enables quantitative analysis of advertising trends, including spend allocation and targeting shifts.

## Practical Applications
- Investigate political influence campaigns during election periods.
- Monitor the spread and evolution of misinformation narratives across advertising networks.
- Analyze changes in advertiser behavior in response to platform policy updates.
- Identify potential violations of platform advertising policies or election laws.
